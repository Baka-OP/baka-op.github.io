## Introduction
Welcome to my website. Here, I will usually post **Devlogs**, **Tutorials**, and random papers about **programming and computer science** in general.

## About
I'm a 15 year old student who's just keenly interested in game and software development. I'm also interested in music and musical theory even though I'm bad at composing stuff. I consider myself to be a slow but steady learner who can grasp stuff pretty well. I also have a constant hunger of knowledge and the new techs. Even though a minimalist, I love checking out the hype-train once in a while.
## Skillset
Since I'm still a student I don't have a vast skill-set. I started programming when I was about 11 years old, in the C# language. Since then I have a moderate experience in Unity, even though I don't have a completed project yet (Time always manages to get me). I can also do python and a little bit of Xamarin.
I also used to be a Minecraft forge modder. Because of that I also have a moderate experience with Java.
Currently I'm trying to learn C++ and maybe produce actual games in the future.
Here's my roadmap progress that I have started about a week ago.

## ...The future?
Though I'm not sure what I want to be in the future, it probably will be tech and computer science engineering oriented, like software development. I also have interest in aviation and aeronautics so I will always look forward to something similar like that too.

#### Thanks for reading along, I hope you will be interested enough to check out my future blog posts and papers ;)
